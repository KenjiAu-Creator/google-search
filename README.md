 From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

 The project is to recreate the search page of google of how to build a website using HTML and CSS. The webpage should not include any functioning links as the goal is to recreate the look of the page only.
